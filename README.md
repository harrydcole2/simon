Simon project for cs260

2/8/23 HTML Simon Project
- Button elements can have SVG or IMG children, which gives the button an interesting design
- <tr> and <td> elements are table row and column elements, which give more control when using tables
- <hr> and <br> are useful tools for adding horizontal line divisions and line breaks respectively
- Text spacing is based on width, not on line breaks in VS code

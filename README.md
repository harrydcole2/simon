Simon project for cs260

2/8/23 HTML Simon Project
- Button elements can have SVG or IMG children, which gives the button an interesting design
- tr and td elements are table row and column elements, which give more control when using tables
- hr and br are useful tools for adding horizontal line divisions and line breaks respectively
- Text spacing is based on width, not on line breaks in VS code

2/21/23 CSS Simon Project
- Absolute positioning with a translation of sorts can help center an element
- Overriding bootstrap qualities may be important as shown in the menu for this project
- Flex with different values: proportion then minimum (calculations also viable here see main)
- display types to override normal ways html is shown
- mess with border radius for shapes
- min-width or height takes priority over normally set width or height to be responsive

3/4/23 JS Simon Project
- we can access local storage to save things about our website on a particular browser so that the facts are remembered, and access it later (keys values)
- document marks the top of our html DOM tree, from which we can select and manipulate elements
- this keyword returns the actual item, which in Simon tends to be an element of the DOM to manipulate
- await keyword which delays something before running it
- JSON is an important way to store data in local storage but removes functions
